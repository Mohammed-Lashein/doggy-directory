Here are my tests for the `App` component after following along [with the tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-test-a-react-app-with-jest-and-react-testing-library) then trying to write the tests by myself without looking at the code.

I needn't clutter github with duplicate source code, so I just added my test.

I added some nice comments to make it easier for myself to write the tests, where you write the steps that you want to achive comment by comment, then below each comment you write the code.

**Sidenote:** I wanted to convert the tabs to spaces in the uploaded file to github, because the tabs width on my editor is low compared to the one present on github.  

I searched and found [this answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17066290/pushing-to-github-messes-up-my-code-indentation) that provides the way to change tabs in a file to spaces.
