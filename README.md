Here is my tests for the `App` component after following along [with the tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-test-a-react-app-with-jest-and-react-testing-library) then trying to write the tests by myself without looking at the code.

I needn't clutter github with duplicate source code, so I just added my test.

I added some nice comments to make it easier for myself to write the tests, where you write the steps that you want to achive comment by comment, then below each comment you write the code.
